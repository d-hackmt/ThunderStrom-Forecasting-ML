# 🌦️ Weather Forecasting Models for North East India 🌍

Welcome to the Weather Forecasting Repository! 🚀 This project focuses on predicting weather conditions for eight cities in the North East region of India using machine learning models trained on authentic real-time weather data collected from IMD (India Meteorological Department) Pune observatories over the past 40 years.

Access the demo app : https://thunderstrom.streamlit.app/

## Models 🤖

The repository contains 8 different models, each representing a city:
- Kolkata 🌆
- Agartala 🌲
- Patna 🏞️
- Gorakhpur 🏰
- Guwahati 🏞️
- Bhubaneswar 🏖️
- Lucknow 🏙️
- Ranchi 🌳


All models are Random Forests, utilizing machine learning techniques to provide accurate weather forecasts.

## Data 📊

Due to data sensitivity, the actual datasets are not provided. However, we've included a demonstration file (`Agartala_Imd_Analysis.ipynb`) that showcases the preprocessing steps and model training using synthetic or dummy data.

## Performance 📈

Out of the three models tested (Random Forest, SVM, and XG Boost), the Random Forest model has shown the best performance in terms of forecasting accuracy. A detailed report on model performance is included in the repository.

## Deployment 🚀

All models have been deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for users to explore weather forecasts for the specified cities.

## Usage 🧑‍💻

To run the Streamlit app locally, make sure to install the required dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, run the app with:
```bash
streamlit run imd.py
```

Explore the weather forecasts a day before the occurrence and stay prepared! ☔⛅❄️
